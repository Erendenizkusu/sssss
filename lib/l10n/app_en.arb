    "gokceadaTarihcesi": "Gökçeada is a district of Çanakkale province and the largest island in Turkey. It has a rich history dating back to the era of the Trojans, and the traces of many different cultures can be found on this island.\n\n The history of Gökçeada goes back to the ancient times when it was known as 'Imbros' by the Greeks. Later, the island came under the rule of the Persian Empire, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, the Ottoman Empire, and finally the Republic of Turkey.\n\n During World War I, due to the strategic importance of the Dardanelles Strait, many battles took place in Gökçeada. Several military bases were established on the island, and conflicts occurred here as well. As a result of these wars, many military cemeteries and memorials were built on the island.\n\n Gökçeada is now an important destination for tourism. Located in the Aegean Sea, this island attracts visitors with its natural beauty, pristine beaches, and historical sites. Additionally, the minorities living on the island (Greeks, Turks, Pomaks) and their cultures contribute to the island's tourist appeal.\n\n Moreover, Gökçeada holds many undiscovered beauties that are yet to be explored by both local and foreign travelers. Therefore, those who wish to visit the island should allocate some time to uncover its hidden treasures.",

    "tavsiyeMetni": " As an islander, I will create a daily itinerary for myself to inspire you for a day trip to Gökçeada.\n\n I would start my day with a delicious and natural breakfast at Begonvil or Mustafan's Kayfesi to recharge my energy. Then, I would go to Zeytinliköy and relax at Cafe Garaj, enjoying a hot coffee and a delightful dessert. This place is cool and comfortable during the hottest hours of the sun. In the afternoon, I would head to Kefalos Beach. I would lie on the sandy shore, watching people surf or even joining them. If I were in a more adventurous mood, I would visit Yıldızkoy. It is Turkey's first and only underwater national park, teeming with colorful fish. I would put on my snorkeling gear and explore the vibrant marine life. I would spread my towel on the warm rocks and sunbathe. In the late afternoon, I would climb up to Yukarı Kaleköy. I would sit on my camping chair and watch the magnificent sunset. If I wanted to end the day with a lovely dinner, I would go to Poseidon. It has a fantastic view but can be quite crowded, so making a reservation in advance is necessary. After the day ends, I would descend to Kaleköy Harbor, grab some ice cream, and stroll around the harbor. It's located below Yukarı Kaleköy and gets lively in the evenings. Finally, I would go to Yıldızkoy to end the day under the stars.",

    "bademli": "After the establishment of Yeni Bademli (also known as Gliki), the village was named Eski Bademli (Gliki), located on a high hill. It is one of the villages with the most beautiful views on the island. Across from it, there is the magnificent Semadirek Island, Kaleköy with its castle ruins, situated on another hill, Kaleköy Harbor with its breakwater, and mountains and valleys completing the panorama. Because of its elevated position, Bademli is also referred to as the balcony of the island.\n\nBademli is one of the four protected villages. Its Turkish name is derived from the numerous almond trees surrounding it. In the past, the village was known as the wealthiest village on the island, engaging in fruit cultivation, sponge diving, and animal husbandry.\n\nWhile wandering through the narrow streets of this small village, you naturally find your way to the village square. Here, you are greeted by the village's old coffeehouse. It features a sundial dating back to 1903. The clock, which was used until recent years, lost its functionality due to the growth of a mulberry tree next to the building, obstructing the sunlight. The village's coffeehouse opens at 10 am. In addition to coffee, various desserts are also available. There is another café in the square opened by a Greek family.\n\nIn 2021, a small shop was also opened in Bademli. This shop offers souvenirs and is a unique place that houses the works of more than 30 designers.\n\nThe village has 150-160 households. During winter, only 2-3 people stay permanently, but in summer, the population reaches around 150 people with visitors coming from Greece and Istanbul. In recent years, some Istanbulites have purchased and restored old houses. The locals of the village are pleased with these culturally sophisticated visitors.\n\nThe primary school constructed by the village through collective labor has been serving as a hotel for some time now. There are no longer any children in need of a school in the village. In addition to accommodation, there are three more hotels in the village that provide restaurant services. The honey farm opened in the village in 2015 has also added a unique touch to the village.\n\nA venerable plane tree stands as a monument in the village. Next to the plane tree, there is a semi-open laundry area. One can imagine that in the past, women used to sit under this tree to rest after washing their laundry.",
    "derekoy": "Dereköy adanın en batı kısmında yer alan bir Rum Köyü. Stratejik konumu ve Pirgos Limanı sayesinde, geçmişte diğer köylere göre ekonomik ve sosyal açıdan daha fazla gelişim göstermiş. Zamanında 1950 hane ile adanın hatta Türkiye'nin en büyük ve kalabalık köyüymüş. İçerisinde 22 kahve, 2 sinema, çok sayıda berber, bakkal, terzi gibi dükkanlar ve 3 zeytinyağı imalathanesi bulunurmuş.\n\nMerkeze 14 km. uzaklıkta, karşılıklı iki tepenin, Halakasi ve Madrabodus Tepeleri yamacında kurulan köy, ortasından geçen yolla ikiye bölünmektedir. Osmanlı gezgini Piri Reis'in 16.yy'da adada bahsettiği iki yerleşim yerinden biri Dereköy'dür (diğeri Kaleköy).\n\nGünümüzde yaz-kış köyde 140-150 hanede yaşam sürmekte. Nüfusun yarısını Rumlar yarısını güneydoğu'dan yerleşen Türkler oluşturmakta. Ama yazın eski ev sahiplerinin köylerini ziyarete gelmesiyle daha çok ev canlanıyor.\n\nKöyde ibadete açık iki kilise bulunuyor. Köyün girişindeki Hagia Marina Kilisesi ve çarşıdaki Koimesis Tis Theotokos Kilisesi. İkisi de 1800'lü yılların başında inşa edilmiş. Dereköy'ün merkezden gelirken solda kalan kısmında, kilisenin bulunduğu meydan, eskiden çarşı meydanıymış. Adanın en büyük çamaşırhanesi hala burada ve ziyaret edilebilir.\n\nKöyde birkaç tane konaklama yeri, oğlak tandır yiyebileceğiniz bir kır restoranı ve restore edilen eski bir rum evinin bahçesine kurulu(Kalyopi Köy Evi) bir kafe bulunuyor.",
    "eselek": "Once a village connected to the Biga district of Çanakkale, Eşelek Village was submerged under water due to dam construction, and the villagers were relocated to this new village in Gökçeada. The historical mosque minaret from their old village also came with them. Engaging in agriculture and animal husbandry, the villagers cultivate the fertile lands surrounding the village, and some are involved in running guesthouses.\n\nLocated 8 km away from the center, the village is the closest settlement to Aydıncık Beach, with a distance of 2 km. Due to its proximity to the beach, it can be a preferred accommodation option. Therefore, during the summer, the villagers rent out their houses as guesthouses.\n\nAll the houses are two-story, with small gardens, and colorful, with a sea view. They are built along the edge of the asphalt road, slightly uphill. The two grocery stores in the village and the fruit and vegetable stands lined up along the road have the capacity to meet your shopping needs while staying here. There are also a couple of restaurants where you can have meals in the village.\n\nKefaloz Beach, which is closer to Eşelek than Aydıncık Beach, is a bay particularly favored by kite surfers.",
    "kalekoy": "Kaleköy, also known by its ancient name Kastro, has been a settlement since ancient times. The village is situated on a hill and has been declared an urban conservation area. Architectural projects must first obtain approval from the monuments board, and only stone buildings are allowed to be constructed. There are no longer any Greeks living in the village. Only families who migrated from Eastern Anatolia 30-40 years ago and recent settlers from the cities reside there.\n\nWith its elevated position, Kaleköy is one of the most beautiful spots on the island to watch the sunset. Semadirek Island emerges in all its splendor right in front of you. Visiting this place during sunset has become a tradition on the island. There are two taverns where you can sit for dinner while facing the sunset. Below the village, there is the Kaleköy harbor, which has been in use since ancient times. To walk from the village to the harbor, you can follow a footpath that dates back to ancient times. Queen Valentina had the Queen's Valentina Road, known as Pelemede Gattilisuo, built in the 1440s for his wife.\n\nKaleköy is the liveliest village on the island in terms of business establishments. From the island's only soap workshop located within a magnificent garden to the cozy café in the town square, from the tavern built on the rocks to the places where you can enjoy handmade gözleme (a type of Turkish pastry), there is a variety of options. The small hotels with stone facades are all beautiful in their own way.\n\nAt the highest point, there are remains of a castle dating back centuries. From the hill where the castle is situated between two bays, you can admire Kaleköy Harbor on one side and Yıldızkoy on the other. The castle, which dates back to pre-Hellenistic times, had its walls repaired and additions made during the Byzantine period.\n\nAround the castle, there are ancient inscriptions, marble architectural remains, and fragments of statues. Moreover, the residents built a cistern called Roksades on the hill to meet their water needs. The significance of this valley lies in its role as the center of religious ceremonies. Some remnants of a temple dedicated to Hermes can still be seen here. It is also noticeable that the walls of the surrounding houses incorporate ancient stones.",
    "kalekoyLiman": "Kaleköy Harbor is the only settlement located along the sea on the island. It is actually a part of Kaleköy, which is situated on the hill. It has been a port that connects the island with the rest of the world for many years. Since the pier is not very deep, large ships used to anchor offshore and transport passengers and goods to the shore using small boats. However, since the establishment of Kuzulimanı, this harbor is no longer used for transportation.\n\nIn recent years, the pier has been expanded and now provides shelter in all weather conditions. While primarily used as a fishing harbor, it also offers a suitable environment for yachts and boats.\n\nDuring summer evenings, Kaleköy Harbor is a favorite spot for tourists. Walking along the promenade, sitting in tea gardens, enjoying ice cream, browsing souvenir stalls, and dining at fish restaurants are some of the ways to spend time here. There are also 2-3 hotels where you can stay in the harbor.\n\nIn Kaleköy Harbor, you can find the Aya Marina Church, which was once the Metropolitan Church of Gökçeada.\n",
    "merkez": "Gökçeada is a district connected to Çanakkale. The district center is the most populous settlement. The central area, formerly known as Panayia, consists of three neighborhoods: Çınarlı Mahallesi, Yeni Mahalle, and Fatih Mahallesi. It is possible to come across examples of local architecture that have preserved their authenticity in these neighborhoods, which were once Greek settlements.\n\nÇınarlı Mahallesi is the part that has preserved its original structure the most. In Çınarlı, there is the Aya Panayia Church, the Center Mosque, which is the island's first mosque dating back to 1813, and two old public laundries.\n\nFatih Mahallesi is located on both sides of the road leading to Kaleköy. This road is home to numerous shops and public buildings. The Metropolitan Building, Metropolitan Church, and Fatih Mosque are also located on this street.\n\nYenimahalle appears as a separate settlement a bit further away from the center. Here, the Aya Varvara Church and an old fountain draw attention.\n\nIn addition to these, various mass housing complexes have been built in the center in the last 20-30 years to meet housing needs. And of course, public buildings, schools, hospitals, pharmacies, banks, ATMs, post offices, and all kinds of shops are concentrated in the center.\n\nThe district center is 7 km away from Kuzulimanı, not located on the seaside. However, it is the place on the island that houses the most hotels and restaurants. Most of the hotels operate year-round.\n\nDuring summer, minibuses depart from here to the beaches and villages. Staying in the center is a good idea for those who want to visit a different beach every day and take advantage of the social facilities in the center.\n\nOn Sundays, an open market is set up in the parking lot area next to the municipality building. You can buy natural products such as vegetables, fruits, tomato paste, olive oil, molasses, soap, and thyme produced by the islanders.\n\nThe City Museum, which is accessed through the building where the old bathhouse is located, is a must-see place on the island. This way, you will perceive the island differently and see it from a different perspective throughout your vacation. By the way, the café in the museum's garden is the only place in the center where you can sit under the trees in a peaceful environment. Moreover, their coffee served with bird's lokum (a type of Turkish delight) is excellent.\n\nThe nostalgic street (İş Bankası Street) in the center, which has been closed to traffic in recent years, attracts attention with its shops, cafes, and restaurants. Don't leave without visiting this street where you can see old island houses and shops.",
    "sahinkaya": "Şahinkaya is the first settlement village of Gökçeada. In the 1960s, the residents of Şahinkaya village in Trabzon were resettled here. However, over time, like the Greeks, they also left their village and migrated to big cities. In the village, only 5-6 families live during the winter. The population increases during the summer. However, the village does not have any open grocery stores or cafes.",
    "sirinkoy": "Şirinköy, the most recently established village in Gökçeada, was opened for settlement in the year 2000. It was established for Turks coming from Bulgaria, and the village consists of 150 households. Due to its proximity to the beaches on the southern coast, such as Gizli Liman and Yuvalı Plajı, it is a preferred village for accommodation. The village houses, which are 120 m2 in size and have 4 rooms, are rented out as apartments during the summer.",
    "tepekoy": "Tepeköy, the highest among the Greek villages situated in elevated areas, is appropriately named. Formerly known as Agridia, the village is located 11 km away from the center. Agridia means \"small fields\" in Greek. The village is built on the slopes of the volcanic Mount Aya Dimitri, offering a breathtaking view, as you would expect.\n\nThe population of the village, which was once 1,200 before 1964, is now only 60. It had turned into a ghost village until Barba Yorgo, who returned to his hometown after living in Istanbul for many years, took the initiative to revive it. He initially started operating a small Greek tavern in the village square. The house wines he produced became well-known under the name of Gökçeada. Later, he moved his tavern to a much larger area at the entrance of the village.\n\nIn recent years, more Greeks have returned to their village. During the summer, the population of the village reaches 400-500 people. The village café is always crowded. Vasil, who moved from Athens to Tepeköy four years ago with his family, runs the café. He enrolled his children in the reopened village school after many years. This is the perfect place to enjoy a frappe and make sure to taste the famous Greek dessert called \"tatlı süt böreği.\"\n\nAcross the café, in the village square, Angelika's tavern has become a unique place. Angelika is one of those who returned to the village, and she warmly welcomes guests in her establishment. Additionally, as travelers to Greek islands often mention, the portions are quite generous. With the opening of Meraklis, a tavern run by Angelika's former chef in the same square, the total number of taverns in the village has reached three. Yanık Kaşık, located under the mulberry tree at the village entrance, is a café where you can stop by for breakfast and mantı, a traditional Turkish dish.\n\nTepeköy is the host village of the famous Virgin Mary Fair, which takes place every year on August 15th. In recent years, the celebrations, which last for ten days, have attracted a large crowd to Tepeköy. Meals are cooked in large cauldrons set up in the square, and people dance and enjoy wine. This fair is a special occasion for the Greeks, and the number of visitors to the village continues to increase, including curious tourists.\n\nIn the village, you can visit the Evangelismos Teotoku Church dating back to 1832 and the old Greek cemetery. Near the village, there is a picnic area known as Çınaraltı (Ispilya). It is a place where you can picnic while enjoying the view, surrounded by a 625-year-old monumental plane tree and an ancient fountain with spring water.\n\nIn the past, the village had two olive oil and soap factories, nine weaving workshops, three kasar cheese factories, and four carpentry workshops. Those who pay attention to details may still find remnants of these structures.",
    "ugurlu": "Uğurlu is a village located at the westernmost tip of the island, 25 km away from the center. At times, this distance sets it apart from the climate of the central area.\n\nThe village was settled in 1984 by villagers from Muğla, Burdur, and Erzincan. The villagers engage in agriculture and livestock farming, claiming that their land is highly fertile and of excellent quality. Grape cultivation is predominantly practiced.\n\nThe village has a port. Uğurlu Port, the only port on the southern coast, was originally built with the idea of serving ferries between Gökçeada and Limni (12 nautical miles). Although the project is currently on hold, this connection could be realized at any moment. At present, large fishing boats take shelter in the port, and locals enjoy fishing. The sea can be accessed from both sides of the village.\n\nGizli Liman, one of the most beautiful bays on the island, is located very close to the village. During the summer, those who want to make the most of this paradise-like natural beach prefer the guesthouses and hotels in Uğurlu. While apartment-style accommodations are common in the village, there are also 3-4 hotels available.\n\nBeing the farthest village from the center, Uğurlu has 4 grocery stores, 2 cafes, 2 butchers, and 3-4 restaurants.",
    "yenibademli": "The village was established on the plain below Old Bademli in 1984. Families from Isparta, Samsun, Trabzon, and Giresun were settled here. As the village with the highest population density on the island, its main sources of livelihood are agriculture and guesthouse accommodation.\n\nLocated 4 km from the center and a 10-minute walk from the sea, Yeni Bademli is one of the most preferred places for tourists to stay. In fact, the village is like a paradise of guesthouses. Some of the villagers have turned their business into a professional venture, while others offer apartment rentals. But they all do their best to make you satisfied. They convey the sincerity and hospitality of Anatolian people.\n\nYıldızkoy, one of the most special spots where you can swim in the sea on Gökçeada, is just a 5-minute walk from Yeni Bademli. Located within the boundaries of Turkey's first underwater park, Yıldızkoy is easily accessible for swimming except on very windy days. Especially if the wind is blowing from the south (lodos), you shouldn't miss the opportunity to swim in its calm sea like a sheet.\n\nYou can take advantage of the grocery stores in Yeni Bademli for shopping. Some villagers also sell fruits and vegetables they gather from their own gardens at their stands. This is the only village outside the center that has a bakery. There are also 2-3 restaurants in the village.\n\nAdditionally, I grew up in this village and brought the Gökçeada application to you :)",
    "zeytinlikoy": "Zeytinliköy used to be one of the most social places on the island. It is still one of the most visited villages due to its numerous cafes. Visiting the village to have dibek coffee has been a long-standing tradition on the island. In recent years, with the opening of cafes by the Greeks who have returned to their villages from Greece, the atmosphere has become even more vibrant. Their menus always include dibek coffee, mastic pudding, and frappe. The Greeks decorate their cafes with a variety of flowers...\n\nThe village has a year-round population of around 50-60 people. As the name suggests, it is surrounded by numerous olive trees. The village is located 3 km away from the center and is one of the four protected villages on the island. The oldest church on the island, Agios Georgios Church, is located in this village.\n\nBartholomew, the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, was born in Zeytinliköy in 1940. Bartholomew, who was declared Patriarch in 1991, visits his birthplace a few times a year.\nIn addition to cafes, Zeytinliköy has 3 boutique hotels and 2 taverns. The taverns located at the entrance of the village are pleasant places where you can sit surrounded by nature.\n\nIf you happen to visit the village in autumn, don't pass by the road lined with blackberries without tasting them!\n\nDibek coffee is made by grinding coffee beans in a 10-kilogram iron pestle and then sifting them through a sieve in a stone-carved pit. The coffee is freshly prepared daily. Although the signs still say dibek coffee, I don't think any of them spend their entire day grinding coffee beans with an iron pestle anymore. But it's okay, as a generation raised on fast food, we no longer have a palate that can distinguish that taste anyway! It's best for you to succumb to its charm and enjoy the pleasure of drinking coffee in the nostalgic atmosphere of the village square that still maintains its charm.",
    "yildizkoy": "-Rocky Beach\n-Jumping Rocks\n-Bar/Cafeteria available\n-Underwater National Park\n\nYıldızkoy is almost the only bay on the north coast of Gökçeada where you can enter the sea. Since the prevailing wind on the island is from the north, this area is generally breezy. However, if you happen to visit on a day when the north wind is light or when the wind is blowing from the south, the sea in Yıldızkoy becomes calm and peaceful.\n\nYıldızkoy is located within the Gökçeada Underwater National Park. It is the only bay in the park where you can enter the sea from the land. Snorkeling in this protected area with its rich marine flora and fauna is a unique pleasure.\n\nYou can reach the bay by car. There is also an old restored chapel within the bay. There are two establishments in the bay that offer beach-restaurant services. They also provide umbrella and sunbed rentals. To make it easier to enter the sea from the rocky shore, a plastic pier is installed every summer.\n\nYıldızkoy features interesting rock formations. It is quite enjoyable to sunbathe on these rocks and then dive into the crystal-clear waters using the stairs leading to the sea, almost like entering an aquarium.\n\nIf you continue walking uphill on the path to the right side of the bay, you can also see Mavi Koyu (Blue Bay), which is located within the underwater park.\n\nFor those who wish to stay close to Yıldızkoy, you can choose to stay at the camping facility in the bay, or opt for accommodations in Yeni Bademli Village or Kaleköy. You can easily reach the bay by walking from these villages.",
    "kefalos": "-Surf Schools\n-Sunbeds and food service\n-Sandy Beach\n-No sudden deepening\n\nThere are numerous accommodation facilities on the beach, all of which offer food service from morning until evening. Most of them provide camping-pension services and private surf lessons as well.\n\nIn recent years, Aydıncık Beach has been gaining popularity as a surf center, especially with Bulgarian and Romanian surfers discovering its potential. As İzmir-Alaçatı, one of the world's important wind-surfing (windsurfing) destinations, has become quite crowded, local surfers are turning their attention to Aydıncık Beach in Gökçeada.\n\nAydıncık Beach is preferred by surfers due to its natural structure and secluded location. Although the beach is on the south coast, it receives the north winds (meltem) without any obstacles. This is because the north winds blowing from the Kefaloz Bay strengthen and flow freely to the south, thanks to the corridor effect created by the low elevation of Tuz Gölü (Salt Lake). This creates an ideal condition for surfing in Aydıncık, with windy but waveless waters. When the wind blows from the south, also known as lodost, the same phenomenon occurs in the opposite direction, and those who want to surf in calm waters head to Kefaloz Bay, which is located right next to Aydıncık.",
    "marmaros": "-Rocky Beach\n-Near a Waterfall\n-Secluded\n\nMarmaros is one of the rare bays on the north coast of the island where you can enter the sea. It is reached by taking a right turn from the road immediately after passing Dereköy. Recently, the road has been closed to traffic as a precaution against forest fires, but it may open at any moment, so keep an eye on updates because this place is one of the must-see natural beauties of the island.\n\nAfter passing through pine forests along a 7 km road, you reach the sea. The beach here is rocky but natural, and the sea is crystal clear. There are no settlements around. Before reaching the beach, you can hike for an hour on a dirt road entered from the right to reach Marmaros Waterfall. During winter and spring, the water flow of the waterfall increases, making it worth seeing.",
    "lazkoyu": "-Sandy Beach\n-Sudden deepening\n-Restaurant\n-Umbrella-Sunbed\n\nLaz Koyu is a small and charming bay located on the southern coast of Gökçeada. It is about 20 km away from the center of Gökçeada and can be reached by car. There is a daily facility in the bay where you can rent umbrellas and sunbeds, as well as enjoy a meal.\n\nKeep in mind that no matter how strong the north wind is, it does not affect Laz Koyu, and the sea remains calm and peaceful.",
    "gizliliman": "-Cave\n-Campground\n-Rocky Beach\n\nGizli Liman, which you can reach by passing through Uğurlu Village, emerges like a surprise when you turn right from the fishing harbor. This is the furthest point you can go on the western tip of the island. It is a heavenly bay with a sandy beach composed of fine sand, stretching in front of pine trees. In the bay, the villagers provide services such as a snack bar, toilet, and shower. Uğurlu Village is very close by for shopping purposes.",
    "kuzulimani": "-Sandy Beach\n-Volleyball net\n-Sunbeds-Umbrellas\n-Café-Restaurant\n\nKuzulimanı, where the ferry docks, has a long and wide sandy beach. The 3-4 day facilities here provide sunbeds, umbrellas, and café-restaurant services. There is also a public toilet and a spacious parking area owned by the municipality. The beach, located on the east side of the island, is sheltered from southern winds, so the sea is very calm when the wind blows from the south (lodost).",
    "feribotsaatleri": "Ferry Timetables",
    "feribilgi": "Sea transportation between Çanakkale and Gökçeada is provided by Gestaş Deniz Ulaşım A.Ş. Ferry services are available daily from Gökçeada to Çanakkale and from Çanakkale to Gökçeada. The frequency of the trips may vary depending on the season and demand, so it is important to check the ferry schedules before traveling.
